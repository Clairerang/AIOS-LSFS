# AIOS-LSFS
This is the official code implementation of paper [From Commands to Prompts: LLM-based Semantic File System for AIOS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.11843).

## üè† Architecture of LSFS

## üöÄ Quickstart

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
```
conda create -n lsfs python=3.11
conda activate lsfs
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### üèÉRun

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please make sure you have read the instructions in [AIOS](https://github.com/agiresearch/AIOS) to set up the environment and launch the AIOS kernel and set up the configurations in ```aios/config/config.yaml```.

> [!WARNING]
> The rollback feature of the AIOS terminal requires the connection to the redis server. Make sure you have the redis server running if you would like to use the rollback feature.

¬∑ You need to create a folder to put the files you want to manage, which will be mounted as the root directory of LSFS. By default, it is ```./root```.

After that, you can run the following command to start the LSFS terminal.

```
python scripts/run_terminal.py
```
When you successfully enter the system, the interface is as follows:

Then you can start interacting with the LSFS terminal by typing natural language commands. 

## üìé Available Functions
LSFS currently supports the following operations, with more features planned for future releases:

| Operation | Description | Example Commands |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| Mount | Mount a directory as the root folder for LSFS | `mount the /root as the root folder for the LSFS` |
| Create | Create files or directories with semantic indexing | `create a aios.txt file in the root folder` |
| Write | Write content to a file | `write 'this is AIOS' into the aios.txt file` |
| Search | Perform keyword-based or semantic retrieval of files | `search 3 files that are mostly related to Machine Learning` |
| Rollback | Restore files to previous versions | `rollback the aios.txt to its previous 2 versions` |
| Share | Generate shareable links for files | `generate a shareable link for the aios.txt` |
